## 🎬 LIVE PRESENTATION SCRIPT

### **OPENING (2 minutes)**

"Good morning everyone, and welcome to Minerds.

[PAUSE]

I'm excited to show you something that's going to change how healthcare data is shared forever. Right now, we have a twenty-five billion dollar healthcare data market, but here's the problem - eighty percent of that valuable data is locked away in silos.

[PAUSE]

Researchers can't access it. Healthcare providers can't monetize it safely. And when data does get shared, there's no way to verify its authenticity or track how it's being used.

[PAUSE]

Today, I'm going to show you how Minerds solves these problems using blockchain technology and something called Soul-Bound Tokens. By the end of this demo, you'll see a complete ecosystem where healthcare data can be shared securely, transparently, and profitably.

[PAUSE]

Let me start by showing you our platform."

---

### **DASHBOARD OVERVIEW (3 minutes)**

[ACTION: Navigate to http://localhost:5173 - Dashboard]

"What you're looking at right now is our platform dashboard. This is mission control for everyone involved - healthcare providers, researchers, administrators, everyone.

[PAUSE]

See these numbers at the top? These are live metrics pulling directly from our blockchain. We currently have... [READ ACTUAL NUMBERS FROM SCREEN] datasets registered, [READ NUMBER] active licenses, and [READ REVENUE] in total platform revenue.

[PAUSE]

Everything you see here updates in real-time. When someone uploads a dataset in Tokyo, when a researcher in London purchases a license, when a hospital in New York registers as a provider - all of that shows up here instantly because it's all recorded on the blockchain.

[PAUSE]

This transparency is crucial. In healthcare data, trust isn't just nice to have - it's absolutely essential. And that's what we're building here - a foundation of trust."

---

### **SECURITY & WALLET CONNECTION (2 minutes)**

[ACTION: Click "Connect Wallet" button]

"Now, security is obviously paramount when we're dealing with healthcare data. Let me connect my wallet to show you how our security works.

[PAUSE]

[ACTION: Complete MetaMask connection]

You'll notice I'm using MetaMask, but we support all major wallets. When I connect, I'm not just logging in - I'm creating a cryptographic identity that's tied to the blockchain.

[PAUSE]

Every single action I take from this point forward will be digitally signed, timestamped, and recorded permanently on the blockchain. This means complete accountability and an audit trail that can never be tampered with.

[PAUSE]

This isn't just good for compliance - it's revolutionary for building trust in an industry that desperately needs it."

---

### **PROVIDER REGISTRATION (2 minutes)**

[ACTION: Navigate to Provider Registration]

"Before anyone can contribute data to our platform, they need to be verified. Let me show you our provider registration process.

[PAUSE]

Healthcare providers - hospitals, research institutions, diagnostic centers - they submit their credentials here. Medical licenses, institutional affiliations, certifications - everything gets verified manually by our compliance team.

[PAUSE]

We also integrate with medical licensing boards to automate verification where possible. The goal is simple: if you see data on our marketplace, you know it comes from a legitimate, verified healthcare provider.

[PAUSE]

This rigorous vetting process is what allows us to charge premium prices and maintain the highest quality standards in the industry."

---

### **DATASET UPLOAD & TOKENIZATION (4 minutes)**

[ACTION: Navigate to Dataset Upload]

"Now here's where the magic happens. This is where healthcare providers can tokenize their datasets. Let me walk you through this process.

[PAUSE]

I'm going to create a sample dataset. Let's say this is COVID-19 patient outcome data from a major hospital system.

[ACTION: Fill out form while speaking]

Dataset name: 'COVID-19 Patient Outcomes Study'  
Description: 'Anonymized patient data from over one thousand COVID cases'  
Type: 'Medical Research Data'  
License terms: 'Research use only, no commercial applications'  
Price: 'Zero point five ETH'

[PAUSE]

Now, when I upload this file, something revolutionary happens. The file itself gets encrypted and stored on IPFS - that's a decentralized storage network. Only the file's digital fingerprint, or hash, gets stored on the blockchain.

[PAUSE]

[ACTION: Upload sample file]

But here's the key innovation - when I submit this, the platform creates what's called a Soul-Bound Token. Unlike regular NFTs that can be traded or sold, Soul-Bound Tokens are permanently tied to the original creator. They can never be transferred or resold.

[PAUSE]

[ACTION: Submit form]

This prevents data from being resold on black markets or used inappropriately. The provider maintains permanent ownership and control, while researchers get legitimate access through our licensing system.

[PAUSE]

And there it is - you can see the transaction being processed on the blockchain right now. This dataset is now permanently registered with immutable proof of its origin and ownership."

---

### **MARKETPLACE BROWSING (3 minutes)**

[ACTION: Navigate to Dataset Marketplace]

"Now let's switch perspectives. I'm now a researcher looking for data. This is our marketplace where I can browse all available datasets.

[PAUSE]

Look at the level of detail we provide. For each dataset, you can see the provider's verification badge, detailed metadata, pricing, licensing terms, and even quality ratings from previous researchers.

[PAUSE]

[ACTION: Use filters]

I can filter by data type, price range, provider reputation - whatever criteria matter for my research. Let's say I'm looking for cardiovascular data under one ETH.

[PAUSE]

[ACTION: Click on a dataset for details]

When I click on a dataset, I get complete transparency. Provider information, data schema, sample sizes, collection methodology - everything a researcher needs to make an informed decision.

[PAUSE]

Notice the feedback section at the bottom. Previous researchers can rate and review datasets. This creates a quality-driven marketplace where good data providers build reputation and command higher prices."

---

### **LICENSE PURCHASE (3 minutes)**

[ACTION: Select a dataset and click "Purchase License"]

"Let me demonstrate how simple it is to purchase access to a dataset. I'll buy a license for this cardiovascular study.

[PAUSE]

When I click 'Purchase License', my wallet opens with the transaction details. The payment is in ETH, but the platform automatically converts pricing to USD for clarity.

[PAUSE]

[ACTION: Sign transaction in MetaMask]

I'm signing this transaction now. What happens next is completely automated by our smart contracts.

[PAUSE]

The payment goes into escrow, the smart contract verifies the transaction, and automatically issues me a Soul-Bound License Token. This license is permanent, non-transferable, and gives me legitimate access to the data.

[PAUSE]

[ACTION: Show transaction confirmation]

There's the confirmation. Transaction hash, license details, everything recorded permanently on the blockchain. The provider gets paid automatically, and I now have legal access to their dataset."

---

### **MY LICENSES & DATA ACCESS (2 minutes)**

[ACTION: Navigate to My Licenses]

"Now that I own a license, let me show you how data access works.

[PAUSE]

Here are all my purchased licenses. Each one shows the dataset details, my license terms, and access controls.

[PAUSE]

[ACTION: Click "Download Dataset"]

When I click 'Download Dataset', the platform automatically verifies my license through the smart contract. If I have valid access, the decryption keys are provided and I can download the data.

[PAUSE]

Every single download is logged for compliance purposes. Providers can see usage analytics, and regulators have complete audit trails. This solves the major problem of data misuse and accountability in healthcare research."

---

### **TRANSACTION MONITORING (2 minutes)**

[ACTION: Navigate to Transaction Monitoring]

"Transparency is crucial for building trust, so let me show you our transaction monitoring dashboard.

[PAUSE]

This shows all platform activity in real-time. Dataset uploads, license purchases, provider registrations - everything that happens on our platform is visible here.

[PAUSE]

Each transaction shows the blockchain hash, timestamp, involved parties, and transaction details. This level of transparency is unprecedented in healthcare data sharing.

[PAUSE]

For regulators and compliance officers, this provides an immutable audit trail that's always available and can never be tampered with."

---

### **DAO GOVERNANCE (2 minutes)**

[ACTION: Navigate to DAO Governance]

"One thing that sets us apart is that our platform is governed by the community through a DAO - a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

[PAUSE]

Here you can see active proposals. Platform fee adjustments, new data categories, quality standards - the community votes on these decisions.

[PAUSE]

[ACTION: Show a sample vote]

Voting power is based on platform participation. Providers, researchers, and token holders all have a say in how the platform evolves.

[PAUSE]

This ensures the platform serves the needs of its users, not just the company. It's democratic governance for the digital age."

---

### **USER MANAGEMENT (2 minutes)**

[ACTION: Navigate to User Management]

"Finally, let me show you our administrative features. Platform administrators can monitor user activity, manage permissions, and ensure compliance.

[PAUSE]

We track provider registrations, researcher activity, growth metrics - everything needed to ensure the platform operates smoothly and safely.

[PAUSE]

There are automated fraud detection systems, suspicious activity alerts, and compliance monitoring tools. We take security and regulatory compliance very seriously."

---

### **CLOSING (3 minutes)**

[ACTION: Return to Dashboard]

"So, what have we just seen? A complete ecosystem that solves the fundamental problems in healthcare data sharing.

[PAUSE]

For healthcare providers, this means they can finally monetize their valuable datasets securely while maintaining complete control and ownership.

[PAUSE]

For researchers, it means access to verified, high-quality datasets with transparent pricing and immutable provenance.

[PAUSE]

For regulators, it provides complete audit trails, automated compliance monitoring, and transparency that's never existed before.

[PAUSE]

The global healthcare data market is worth twenty-five billion dollars annually and growing at twenty-five percent year over year. We're positioned to capture significant market share by solving the trust and access challenges that have plagued this industry for decades.

[PAUSE]

We're not just building a platform - we're creating the infrastructure for the next generation of medical breakthroughs. Imagine AI models trained on verified, high-quality datasets. Imagine research that can be reproduced and validated because every piece of data has immutable provenance.

[PAUSE]

That's the future we're building with Minerds.

[PAUSE]

We're launching on Polygon mainnet in Q2 2025, we're in partnership discussions with major health systems, and we're opening our Series A funding round.

[PAUSE]

The question isn't whether blockchain will transform healthcare data - it's whether you'll be part of that transformation.

Thank you."
